# chainlink-hackathon-2021 - CheerMEder

## Inspiration
Taking part in live sport events may be something of the past for the foreseeable future.  

CheerMEder will give spectators their own voice back.  CheerMEder will allow a cheerer to clap hands or a 'hoo-hoo', with each clap costing them a micro donation to the team they cheer on.

## What it does
1.   A cheerer will set up their profile with a 'hand clap' cheer and a 'hoo-hoo' cheer.  These cheers will be minted as NFTs, so the cheerer has a truly unique cheer.
2.  A cheerer will buy a ticket to take part in an event, but the ticket value does not leave the cheerers wallet.  It is moved to 'cheer' coins.
3.  During the game the cheerer can presses 'hand clap' or 'hoo-hoo' buttons for the team, which will move 'cheer' coins to the respective team.
4.  Realtime totals of the cheerers 'cheer' token balance, and the team balances will be show on the screen.
5.  As the micro-donation takes place, the cheerers own NFT sound will be played at the event, and thus their donation is turned into real sound.
6.  At he end of the game an lottery will take place where one cheerer will win all the remaining tokens left in all other cheerers that watched the gamee.
7.  (Stretched goal) Crowdsource margin calls in a game.  In tennis, making a call on if the ball was in or out, in soccer, if a player was offside.
